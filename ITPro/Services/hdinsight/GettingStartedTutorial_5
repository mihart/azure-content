##<a name="sample"></a>Run a Sample MapReduce Job from the Sample Gallery

The WordCount sample is one of the samples in the gallery. The sample contains MapReduce programs written in Java that together count word occurrences in a text. The following diagram illustrates how MapReduce works on the word counting.

![HDI.WordCountDiagram](../media/HDI.WordCountDiagram.gif "Word Count MapReduce Diagram")

The output is a set of key-value pairs. The key is a string that specifies a word and the value is an integer that specifies the total number of occurrences of that word in the text. This is done in two stages. The mapper (the cat.exe in this sample) takes each line from the input text as an input and breaks it into words. It emits a key/value pair each time a work occurs of the word followed by a 1. The reducer (the wc.exe in this sample) then sums these individual counts for each word and emits a single key/value pair containing the word followed by the sum of its occurrences.

To run the WordCount sample:

1. Click the **WordCount** tile in the Hadoop Sample Gallery. The page provides the description and downloads for running the sample. 

	![HDI.WordCountSampleDeployment](../media/HDI.WordCountSampleDeployment.PNG "WordCount Sample Deployment")

	The downloads include the following files:

	* **davinci.txt**: the input text file
	* **hadoop-examples.jar**: the jar files that contains the files needed by Hadoop on Azure to deploy the application. 
	* **WordCount.java**: the WordCount Java program file.
	* **WordCount.js**

2. Click **Deploy to your cluster** on the right-hand side of the page to begin the deployment. This brings up the **Create Job** page with the fields populated with the Wordcount sample data. 

	![HDI.CreateWordCountJob](../media/HDI.CreateWordCountJob.PNG "Create WordCount Job")

	The *job name* and *parameters* have been assigned default values that will run the WordCount job. 

	**Parameter 1** specifies, respectively, the path/name of the input file (asv:///example/data/gutenberg/davinci.txt) and the output directory where the results will be saved (asv:///DaVinciAllTopWords). The input text file analyzed is the Project Gutenberg eBook edition of "The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci". It comes with the HDInsight deployment.

	The use of the asv:// prefix in the paths of these files. This is needed to indicate Azure Blob Storage is being used for input and output files. The output directory assumes a default path relative to the asv:///user/&lt;username&gt; folder. 

	<!--is the following paragraph correct? -->

	For the purpose of this introduction, the default prefix is being retained. But it is a best practice to use the secure SSL version, asvs://, for transferring your data when you are in production. For information on how to use the secure transport, see [Using HDInsight to process Blob Storage data](/en-us/manage/services/hdinsight/process-blob-data-and-write-to-sql/).

	The **Final Command** contains the Hadoop jar command that executes the MapReduce program with the parameter values provided above. 


3. Click **Execute job** to run the MapReduce job.

7. The status of the deployment is provided on the **Job Info** page and it will indicate when the program has completed, as shown here.
